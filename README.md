This repository contains assets for HydroNet presentations.

## Generate the HydroNet launch deck

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install python-pptx
   ```
2. Run the generator script:
   ```bash
   python build_hydronet_ppt.py
   ```
3. Find the generated file `水网大模型与自主运行水网智能体体系（HydroNet）.pptx` in the project root.

The script creates a 50-slide, 16:9 wide-screen presentation with chapter structure, bullet points, and presenter notes ready for customization.
